# War-Game
A modified version of the card game War.

Here are the game rules:
- The game starts by asking the players for their names.
- On the version you will be creating, each player starts with 26 points. When the game begins a random number between 1 and 10 will be generated for both players. The initial score is displayed.
- Whoever gets the higher number, wins a point. 
- The loser with the lower number loses a point.
- In the case of a tie (that is, the same random number is generated for both players), nobody earns or loses a point.
- The score and the winners are displayed EACH time.
- This process continues until one of the players loses all of his/her points or when a player gets 52 points. 
- The winner is the person who ends up with 52 points.

NOTE: These are the additional things/features I added to my program:
1. Used a function 
2. Created counters for total number of rounds played, rounds won by player 1, rounds won by player 2, and rounds tied
3. Presented in a organized and neat way with graphics 
4. Incorporated a 'Prize' feature which gives the winner of the game a prize 
5. Incorporated a "Fun Questionnaire" feature so that it is more interactive 
6. Asked the user if they want to play again - used loops
7. Allowed user to have the option to play against a friend or Rosie The Robot
8. Included a Game Summary 
9. User gives a rating for the card game
