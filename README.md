# War-Game
A modified version of the card game War.

Here are the game rules:
-The game starts by asking the players for their names.
-On the version you will be creating, each player starts with 26 points. When the game begins a random 
number between 1 and 10 will be generated for both players. The initial score is displayed.
-Whoever gets the higher number, wins a point. 
-The loser with the lower number loses a point.
-In the case of a tie (that is, the same random number is generated for both players), nobody earns or 
loses a point.
- The score and the winners are displayed EACH time.
-This process continues until one of the players loses all of his/her points or when a player gets 52 points. 
-The winner is the person who ends up with 52 points.
